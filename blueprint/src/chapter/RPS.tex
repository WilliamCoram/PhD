\chapter{Restricted Power Series}

Formal power series over a set $K$ in one variable, written $K [ \! [ x ] \! ] $, are
infinite sums
\[
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n, \quad \forall i, \; a_i \in K.
\]
When $K$ is a ring, we can show power series over $K$ form a ring, and we will often refer to them
as the ring of power series over $K$, denoted by $\mathcal{F}_K$.

We define a subset of $\mathcal{F}$ that consists of power series whose coefficeients approach zero,
to do this we first better make sure $K$ is a normed ring

\begin{definition*}
A normed ring is a pair $(R,\lvert \cdot \rvert)$, of a ring and a norm.
\end{definition*}

With this we define,

\begin{definition}
    \label{PowerSeries.IsRestricted}
    \lean{PowerSeries.IsRestricted}
    \leanok
    Let $f$ be a power series over a normed ring $R$ in one variable, write
    $f = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n$, and let $c$ be a real number.
    We say $f$ is a restricted power series of parameter $c$ over $K$ if
    \[
    \lim_{n \to \infty} \lvert a_n \rvert c^n = 0.
    \]
\end{definition}

Note this is not the same as convergent power series in the usual sense unless $R$ is complete,
since in complete spaces Cauchy sequences converge.

It turns out that restricted power series of parameter $c$ are not just a set, in fact we have the
following.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{PowerSeries.Restricted.IsGroup}
  \lean{PowerSeries.Restricted.IsGroup}
  \leanok
  Restricted power series over a normed ring $R$ form an additive group.
\end{theorem}

Moreover, if the norm of $R$ has the non-archimedean property,

\begin{definition*}
  We say a norm is non-archimedean if
  \[
  \lvert a + b \rvert \leq \max \{ \lvert a \rvert, \lvert b \rvert\}.
  \]
  Else the norm is archimedean.
\end{definition*}

we can strengthen this lemma.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{PowerSeries.Restricted.IsRing}
  \lean{PowerSeries.Restricted.IsRing}
  \leanok
  Restricted power series over a non-archimedean normed ring $R$ form a ring.
\end{theorem}

The importance of the non-archimedean property can be seen in the following example.

Let $f = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{\sqrt{n+1}}x^n$ be a power series over $\mathbb{R}$
equipped with the standard norm. Then it is immediate to see that $f$ is a restricted power series
for the parameter 1. However, the product $f^2$ has coefficients
\[
b_n = (-1)^n \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{1}{(n - k -1)(k+1)},
\]
and it can be shown that
\[
\lvert b_n\rvert \geq \sum_{k = 0}^n \frac{2}{n + 2} = \frac{2 (n + 1)}{(n + 2)}.
\]
Therefore $\lim_{n \to \infty} \lvert b_n \rvert \geq \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{2(n+1)}{(n+2)}=2$,
that is $f^2$ is not a restricted power series for parameter 1, and we see multiplication is not
closed.

We now suppose that $K$ is a non-archimedean complete field; that is a field equipped with a metric
that is complete and whose metric has the non-archimedean property as defined earlier. We give a
new name to restricted power series with these $K$.

\begin{definition}
    When $K$ is a non-archimedean complete field we denote the ring of restricted power series with
    parameter $c$ over $K$ by $\mathcal{A}_c(K)$ and call it the Tate algebra over $K$ of parameter
    $c$.
\end{definition}

As mentioned earlier, this set is equivalent to power series that converge on the ball of radius
$c$, and so sometimes in literature the Tate algebra may be referenced as convergent power series.
