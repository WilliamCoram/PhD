\chapter{Introduction}

This page consists of the outline for my PhD project. Ultimately, the goal is to formalise results
on $p$-adic modular forms - however there will be a lot of foundational work required to get to this
point.

Right now the goal is to formalise Daniel Jacobs thesis "slopes of compact Hecke operators".
